This is a repository of my personal Home Assistant Configuration. I am no expert so I've made it mostly for myself to keep track of my personal development and to track issues with it.
Of course feel free to look around. Maybe you'll get some inspiration. If you find I've done something stupid andhave a better way to implement it do let me know. </p>
